/**
 * Drop out is a technique introduced by [1] for regularizing a network and helps prevents over fitting. It works
 * by randomly selecting neurons and forces them to be off. The chance of a neuron being turned off is specified
 * by the drop rate. It's behavior is different when in learning or evaluation mode. In learning mode it will
 * decide if a neuron is dropped using a probability of drop_rate*100, drop_rate is 0 to 1.0, inclusive.
 * In evaluation mode it scales each input by 1.0 - drop_rate.
