 * The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) is defined as:
 * <pre>
 * tanh(x) = sinh(x)/cosh(x) = 2*&sigma;(2*x) - 1
 * </pre>
 * where &sigma;(x) is the sigmoid function, sinh and cosh are hyperbolic sine and cosine functions. It has
 * a range of -1 to 1. Converges towards 1 for positive numbers and -1 for negative numbers.
